          During my time at UD, I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. 
          
          I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance. 
          
          Outside of coursework, I attended Hackathons such as Hack@Brown and HopHacks. I spent a good amount of my free time experimenting with Unix and self-hosting applications.
